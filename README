This is the share repository for the Atlanta Functional Programming User Group's project Euler solutions. I wanted to set up a single place for us all to put our solutions to increase collaboration and maybe cause some healthy competition. If you would like to add you solution here, please fork this repository, add a folder with your github user name and send a pull request. I'll integrate them straight away. Enjoy!
